# LiveInLife
Another Arma 3 Life Modification

## What is LiveInLife
**LiveInLife** was a small idea of creating an free-to-use "library" (it isn't really is a library...) for ArmA 3 RPG-Server's. **LiveInLife** was created to support developers of RPG-Server's who want to create their own RPG-Modification.
There are currently just a few packages available because **LiveInLife** is in development status - problems and other issues are common in this state.

**LiveInLife** do not pretend anything in your mission - it's up to you choose between possibilities!
